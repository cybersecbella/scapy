# AI PCAP Analyst — Network Forensics Enhancements
> Built by [cybersecbella]([https://www.cybersecbella.com/articles/pcap_analyst/]) |
> Fork of [secdev/scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy)

A network forensics pipeline built on top of Scapy. Detects BGP hijacking, C2 beaconing, DNS exfiltration, and suspicious traffic patterns — then exports findings to TheHive with plain-English AI-generated threat narratives.

## What it does

Feed it a PCAP file and get back:
- **BGP hijack alerts** — RPKI-validated route announcements flagged by origin ASN
- **C2 beaconing detection** — statistical analysis of packet timing (low CV = malware)
- **DNS exfiltration alerts** — high-entropy subdomains flagged with Shannon entropy score
- **AI threat narrative** — Claude explains every finding in plain English

---

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cybersecbella/scapy
cd scapy
pip install -r requirements_ai.txt
```

### 2. Set your API key
```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env
```

### 3. Analyze a PCAP
```bash
python -m ai_pcap_analyst analyze suspicious.pcap
```

### 4. dns_exfil -  returns potential data exfiltration attempts masquerading as legitimate DNS queries
```
python ai_pcap_analyst/dns_exfil.py tests/sample_pcaps/dns_test.pcap
```

### 5. beaconing.py - looks for periodic communication patterns and suspicious port usage within network traffic
```
python ai_pcap_analyst/beaconing.py tests/sample_pcaps/monitoring_beaconing.pcap
```

### 6. bgp_hijack.py - returns the prefix and ASN; checks validation status 
```
python ai_pcap_analyst/bgp_hijack.py tests/sample_pcaps/pakistan_telecom_bgp_hijack.pcap
```

## Detection methods explained

**DNS exfiltration** — attackers encode stolen data as base64 in DNS
subdomains (`aGVsbG8=.evil.com`). Detected by measuring Shannon entropy
of each subdomain label — legitimate domains score ~2.5, encoded data
scores ~3.9+.

**C2 beaconing** — malware checks in at regular intervals (e.g. every
60 seconds). Detected by measuring the coefficient of variation (CV) of
inter-packet timing — human traffic has CV > 0.5, malware beacons have
CV < 0.15.

**BGP hijacking** — attackers announce IP prefixes they don't own to
redirect traffic. Detected by validating each announcement against RPKI
(Resource Public Key Infrastructure) using the free RIPE NCC API.
